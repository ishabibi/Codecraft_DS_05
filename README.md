📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following visual analyses were performed:

1.	Accidents by Time of Day

o	Countplot showing distribution of accidents across different times (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night).

2.	Weather Conditions

o	Top weather scenarios where accidents occur most frequently.

3.	Road Type Analysis

o	Accidents distribution across various road categories.

4.	Accident Severity


o	Visual representation of severity levels and their frequency.
